### About me:

Since childhood I have been fascinated by the field of IT. If at a preschool age it was video games, then later it was attempts at animation and creation of simple games in Flash. Then on various courses I practiced writing programs in Delphi, Pascal. Did a simple mods for the games (texture substitution and translation of other mods, scripts). Tried to create pages of websites in HTML + CSS + JS. So, when I went to college I knew for sure, that my professional field will be related to programming. Solving complex problems and finding the best solutions was a pleasure.

I entered the Information Security, where I became acquainted with several programming languages, including C++ and SQL (topic of my bachelor's thesis: "Development of SQL-attack protection methods").

As part of my studies, I was also involved in:
- installing and working with virtual machines on Hyper-V and Virtual Box to administer Linux and Windows (undergraduate diploma work used XAMPP with Apache on Win 10; separately in one course required WSL to work with openssl)
- setting up DLP systems;
- backend in JS (Express).

By the time of entering graduate school I have chosen for myself the main programming language, which seemed to me easy to learn, but at the same time deep and extensible in its application to different tasks - Python. I began to use it practically in all disciplines of the course, I was helped by my supervisor, who was programming in Python more than 10 years (mathematical, graphing, modeling Word + Excel routines and modeling of some social processes were among my tasks). With the help of the same language I wrote my dissertation "Active Web Server Auditing" - IPS development in Python.

By graduation, I had already mastered "Introducing Python, Modern Computing in Simple Packages, Lubanovic B." and studied various videos, took courses which, although they did not give me new knowledge on the basics, but helped me learn to comply with PEP8, work with PyCharm more intelligently, as well as normally interact with Git systems. And, naturally, that's when I already started writing projects.

I like to improve in my chosen field. I have experience working in a team, I am respectful to its members, I take deadlines seriously. I can competently distribute time resources between tasks, I use time trackers. Appreciate support and constructive criticism.
